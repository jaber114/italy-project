            <div class="a">Top five Chocolate places in italy</div>
            
            <div class="b"  style="color:darkred">1. Torino, Piedmont<p>The first region that comes to mind when talking about Italian chocolate is the Piedmont region. The capital of the region, Turin, has a long association with the cacao delicacy. Cacao was brought to the city by the end of the 1500s when Catherine, daughter of Filip of Spain, married Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy. At the European courts, the food was originally consumed as a drink, appreciated for its invigorating properties.The first cioccolateria (a forerunner of today’s cafes where the hot cacao drink was served) was opened in Turin in 1678, as testified by a written document granting chef Giovanni Antonio Ari regal permission to sell the creamy chocolate drink for six years. In the following years, many other Turinese chocolate shops followed, gradually turning the city into a European center of chocolate making, with a daily production averaging 350kg at that time.</p></div>               
            <div class="c"><img src="chopic\1.jpg" width="500" height="500" class="center" /> </div>
            <div class="b" style="color:burlywood">2. Modica, Sicily<p>Another Italian town famous for its chocolate, is Modica, one of the late baroque towns of Sicily located in the Val di Noto. Modica’s chocolate (cioccolato modicano), produced according to a special recipe that is said to date back to the 1500s, has a very singular taste and texture. The recipe is believed to descend directly from the Aztec tradition brought to Sicily by the Spaniards during the Spanish occupation of the County of Modica. It is exclusively a cold-working process, during which there is no conching of the chocolate mass. During the conching stage, modern chocolate is heated at high temperatures to produce a perfectly smooth texture that melts in the mouth. Instead, during the production of Modica’s chocolate, the chocolate mass is kept below the temperature at which sugar melts, throughout the process, which gives the cioccolato modicano its typical granular texture.</p></div>               
            <div class="c"><img src="chopic\2.jpg" width="500" height="500" class="center" /> </div>
            <div class="b" style="color:brown">3. Naples, Campania<p>Two of the most famous historic chocolatiers in Napels are Gay-odin and Scaturchio. The latter one, renowned since 1905 for its Ministeriali, is located in the historic center of Naples, on Piazza Domenico Maggiore. Legend has it that during the early years of the unification of Italy, Francesco Scaturchio, founder of the chocolate shop, fell in love with a chanteuse, and to conquer her heart he invented a chocolate medallion with creamy filling, the Ministeriali. The delicacy, confectioned according to a secret recipe, comes in two different shapes.</p></div>               
            <div class="c"><img src="chopic\3.jpg" width="500" height="500" class="center" /> </div>
            <div class="b" style="color:blanchedalmond">4. Perugia, Umbria <p>Perugia is home to the Perugina chocolate and to one of the most important chocolate fairs in Italy, Eurochocolate. The Casa del Cioccolato, the famous chocolate museum founded in 1997, is located in Viale San Sisto 207/C. Another institution in Perugia dedicated to chocolate is the Pasticceria Sandri, in Corso Vannucci 32, the most ancient pasticceria of Umbria. It is still run by the descendants of the same family of Swiss confectioners Schucani who came to Italy in the 1800s. The beautiful pasticceria with vaulted ceilings and Liberty-style furniture sells sweets and chocolate based on a fusion of the Swiss and perugin traditions. Worth a mention is also the historic chocolatier Talmone, in Via Maestà delle Volte 12 traditionally the rival of the Perugina shop in Corso Vannucci. </p></div>

            <div class="b" style="color:goldenrod">5. Pistoia and the Chocolate Valley, Tuscany<p>The Chocolate Valley referes to the strip of land that goes from Prato to Pisa, with Pistoia in its center, home to some of the region’s most renowned chocolatiers. Considered the other chocolate capital of Italy, the area offers many specialized touristic itineraries. Famous chocolatiers include Roberto Catinari from Agliana, Andrea Trinci in Cascine di Buti and the Cioccolateria Slitti in Monsummano Terme by Andrea Slitti, world champion chocolatier and first Italian to win the Grand Prix de la Chocolaterie in Paris.The latter serves, besides delicious chocolate treats, also excellent coffee.</p></div>
